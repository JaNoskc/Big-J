            <h1>My First Job:</h1>
            <p class="big" class="border">I started by working for my parents by cleaning an AirBnB out in Hurricane, Utah called Sky Ranch. We would clean, do pool maintainence, do yard work, along with random house work. I ended up leaving the job because I wanted more hours/money. That's when I started looking for another job at the age of 15 years old.</p>

            <h1>My Current Job:</h1>
            <p class="big" class="border">My second job (current job) is Jimmy John's. I was able to get the job because my sister works there and has good connections, so I was able to get in touch with the general manager of the store and started working in April of 2024. The job consists of making sandwiches while also keeping a clean and well organized store. This means that I would prepare food for the next day and store them in their designated locations. So far I love the job and the work environment is great. The people there have a great personality and are fun to work with,</p>
